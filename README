To make this work you will have to download and install PostgreSQL. This can be done from https://www.postgresql.org/download/ (I use the 9.5.12 version).
When it is installed, you should make sure you have a database called "Library". Also, make sure that the password set in books.py, videos.py and music.py corresponds to the password you choose when you install postgreSQL.


Then you have to make sure psycopg2 and tkinter is installed. This can be done by running these commands in a command prompt:

	pip install psycopg2
	pip install tkinter

If you want to make an executable of this, I have done this by running the following command:

	pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name Library --log-level ERROR mainMenu.py

I made this project when following the udemy course "The Python Mega Course: Build 10 Real World Applications" taught by Ardit Sulce. The idea there was to make it a simple book store app that used sqlite3(a local database) and was lacking some of the functions used here.
